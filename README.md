# **Dotfiles**

This are the config files i am using on my environments.
I plan to upgrade this repo with original scripts and configs, since now is just a frankenstein of other people code. 

My Wayland configs are based from [1amSimp1](https://github.com/1amSimp1e/) files, you can seer them [here](https://github.com/1amSimp1e/dots).
I based myself and got almost all my old configs from [Jorgeloopz](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz), he has a good taste and organize his configs well. I really recommend to [check it out](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles).â€‹ 

### **Dislaimer**:
First of all, this repo is far from complete, so be aware that my workarounds and minor diferences are not here, use it wisely and have patience with installtion if you are goning to do it. 

I used X display in my old setups beacause nvidia can be a lot stuborn with Wayland, that was, until i got my laptop and PC stolen. Since that, got a new laptop with AMD graphics, wich allowed me to use Wayland. Thats the reason that my [old setups](https://github.com/Davi-K-Silva/dotfiles/tree/old_dots) and configs have different settings and programs.
