# **Dotfiles**

This are the config files im using on my environments.
I plan to upgrade this repo with original scripts and configs, since now is just a frankenstein of other people code

I based myself and got almost all my configs from [Jorgeloopz](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz), he has a good taste and organize his configs well.

I really recommend to check [it](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/dotfiles) out ðŸ‘ˆâ€‹
